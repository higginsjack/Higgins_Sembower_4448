The UML changed drastically from conception to completion of the project. Every class increased in number of methods and attributes. Activities methods receive an instance of FNCD object and return an instance of the FNCD object. Vehicle now contains methods for increasing cleanliness of a car, fixing a car, and randomly initializing the cleanliness and condition of the vehicle. Staff contains a new attribute for how much money theyâ€™ve made. There are also new methods for getting random numbers and getters/setter for the attributes. FNCD now contains an ArrayList of staff that previously worked for FNCD and an ArrayList of vehicles that have been sold. There are also methods in FNCD for updating staff, selling vehicles, and finding if a staff member is currently working.
